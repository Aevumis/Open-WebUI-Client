## 🔧 Updated Files

- **eas.json**: Enhanced with proper build profiles and signing configuration
- **package.json**: Added convenient build scripts

## 🎯 Quick Start Commands

### For New Team Members
```bash
# One-command setup
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
```

### For Building
```bash
# Development builds
npm run build:dev              # Local development build
npm run build:dev:cloud        # Cloud development build

# Preview builds  
npm run build:preview          # Local preview build
npm run build:preview:cloud    # Cloud preview build

# Production builds
npm run build:prod             # Cloud production build (AAB)
npm run build:prod:apk         # Cloud production build (APK)

# Utility commands
npm run build:clean            # Clean build with cache reset
npm run credentials:android    # Manage Android signing credentials
```

### Using Build Script Directly
```bash
# Basic usage
./scripts/build.sh -p development -l    # Local development build
./scripts/build.sh -p production        # Cloud production build
./scripts/build.sh -p preview -l -c     # Local preview build with cache clean

# Get help
./scripts/build.sh -h
```

## 🔐 Signing Setup

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# EAS will automatically generate and manage your keystore
eas build --profile production --platform android
# Select "Yes" when prompted to create a new keystore
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Check current signing credentials
npm run credentials:android

# View keystore details
eas credentials --platform android
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
- **Triggers on**: Push to main/develop, PRs to main, manual dispatch
- **Builds**: Appropriate profile based on branch/trigger
- **Uploads**: APK artifacts for download
- **Comments**: Build status on PRs
- **Notifies**: Team on build failures

### Manual Workflow Trigger
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Build Android APK" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose build profile
5. Click "Run workflow"

## 📱 APK Distribution

### Development/Testing
- Download from GitHub Actions artifacts
- Share APK files directly with team
- Install via ADB: `adb install app.apk`

### Production
- **Play Store**: Use AAB builds (`production` profile)
- **Direct Distribution**: Use APK builds (`production-apk` profile)

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Keystore Management
- ✅ **Automatic keystore generation** via EAS
- ✅ **Secure cloud storage** of signing credentials
- ✅ **Team access control** through Expo accounts
- ✅ **Regular backups** via `eas credentials` download

### Environment Security
- ✅ **Environment variables** properly configured
- ✅ **No sensitive data** in version control
- ✅ **Secure CI/CD** with encrypted secrets
